# Political Contribution Monitor - Technical Write-up

## Overview

This document outlines the technical decisions, trade-offs, and future improvements for the Political Contribution Monitoring web application. The system is designed to help financial services firms monitor political contributions for compliance purposes using Federal Election Commission (FEC) data.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and consistent design
- **State Management**: React Context API with useReducer for global state
- **Charts**: Chart.js with react-chartjs-2 for data visualization
- **Forms**: React Hook Form for efficient form handling
- **File Upload**: React Dropzone for CSV/TXT file processing
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for API communication

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Data Processing**: Custom data processor with fuzzy matching using Fuse.js
- **CSV Handling**: csv-parser and csv-writer for data import/export
- **String Matching**: string-similarity for name variations
- **Date Handling**: Moment.js for date parsing and manipulation
- **Security**: Helmet.js for security headers, CORS enabled

### Data Storage
- **Current**: In-memory storage with file-based persistence
- **Sample Data**: Built-in sample data for development and testing
- **FEC Data**: Support for FEC CSV format with automatic parsing

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Fuzzy Name Matching
**Decision**: Implemented fuzzy matching using Fuse.js with configurable thresholds
**Rationale**: Political contribution data often contains name variations (e.g., "John Smith" vs "J. Smith" vs "John W. Smith"). Fuzzy matching improves search accuracy without requiring exact matches.
**Trade-offs**: 
- Pros: Better user experience, handles typos and variations
- Cons: Potential false positives, requires tuning of similarity thresholds

### 2. In-Memory Data Storage
**Decision**: Used in-memory storage with file-based persistence for development
**Rationale**: Simplified development and deployment while maintaining performance for moderate dataset sizes
**Trade-offs**:
- Pros: Fast queries, simple implementation, no database setup required
- Cons: Limited scalability, data lost on server restart, memory constraints

### 3. RESTful API Design
**Decision**: RESTful API with clear endpoint structure
**Rationale**: Standard approach that's easy to understand, document, and maintain
**Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/search` - Individual search with query parameters
- `POST /api/bulk-search` - Bulk search with multiple names
- `GET /api/export/:searchId` - Export results in CSV format
- `GET /api/analytics/:searchId` - Analytics and risk scoring

### 4. Risk Scoring Algorithm
**Decision**: Implemented custom risk scoring based on multiple factors
**Factors Considered**:
- Contribution amounts (higher amounts = higher risk)
- Number of contributions (more contributions = higher risk)
- Recent activity (recent contributions = higher risk)
- Multiple recipients (more recipients = higher risk)
- Total contribution volume

**Scoring Range**: 0-100 with categories (Low: 0-39, Medium: 40-69, High: 70-100)

## Trade-offs Made

### 1. Performance vs. Accuracy
- **Choice**: Prioritized search speed over perfect accuracy
- **Impact**: Fast response times but may miss some edge cases in name matching
- **Mitigation**: Configurable similarity thresholds allow tuning based on requirements

### 2. Simplicity vs. Features
- **Choice**: Focused on core features first (search, export, basic analytics)
- **Impact**: Clean, maintainable codebase but limited advanced features
- **Future**: Can add advanced features incrementally

### 3. Development Speed vs. Production Readiness
- **Choice**: Optimized for rapid development and prototyping
- **Impact**: Working application quickly but requires hardening for production
- **Areas for Production**: Authentication, rate limiting, data validation, error handling

## What I Would Do Differently with More Time

- **Better Approach**: Scheduled data updates from FEC API
- **Benefits**: Always current data, automated compliance monitoring

### 4. User Authentication & Authorization
- **Current**: No authentication
- **Better Approach**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access
- **Benefits**: Multi-tenant support, audit trails, compliance requirements

### 5. Advanced Analytics
- **Current**: Basic charts and risk scoring
- **Better Approach**: Machine learning models for pattern detection
- **Benefits**: Predictive analytics, anomaly detection, automated risk assessment

## Production Scaling Strategy

### 1. Infrastructure
